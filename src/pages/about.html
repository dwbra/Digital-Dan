                <p>Hi, I'm Daniel Workman, junior developer and all round life enthusiast. My education story and career progression leading into my decision to become a software developerer are an important part of why I love coding and look forward to a job in the industry. After completing my HSC at Scots College I attended University of Wollongong and in 2014 completed a Bachelor In Commerce majoring in Marketing. Upon the completion of my degree I went abroad to travel and live for around two years. When I came back I was recharged and ready to lock into working life. I got an internship with a start up to do with green energy. This was an interesting position and was where I got my first experience with digital marketing and website development. As a start up they had no one with development skills and I volunteered to update the website and optimise it for SEO. This was my first introduction into development and I thoroughly enjoyed it despite a very small understanding of coding. After six months a job opporutinity arouse in a local marketing agency and I was lucky enough to secure a position as a junior Digital Producer. I've worked in the same company for over three nows and thoroughly enjoyed my time there, still to this day. In this role I was expose to a lot of marketing and digital technologies to which website development again was a focus. Over the years the interest grew and grew until I really realised that as much as I enjoyed Digital Marketing that I wanted to move into software development.</p>
